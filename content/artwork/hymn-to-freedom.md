A mix of flapping and gliding during the flight makes swallow's dance so beautiful and elegant.

The symbolism of a swallow bird is usually associated with love, loyalty and peace. This wonderful creature are joyful, decisive and full of hope.

This painting can be considered experimental, being part of those works that just surprise you in the end.

Last coat of gloss varnish gives preciousness and protects artwork by harmful external factors.

I use high quality colours and gallery wrap canvas (has staples at the back). The painting's edges are already varnished in harmony with rest of the composition. The artwork can be already hung on your wall.

No need to frame - looks fabulous in this contemporary style.

I believe this gorgeous swallows painting will create an impressive statement in your house.
