Aurora Borealis has always fascinated me. I wanted to see this phenomenon in reality since I was young.

When it comes to birches as a subject for my canvases, I have always imagined this range of colours precisely because I want so much to get there finally, at the Polar Night.

I use high quality colours and gallery wrap canvas (has staples at the back). The edges are already painted in harmony with the rest of the composition. The painting is ready to be hung on your wall.

Last coat of gloss varnish gives preciousness and protects artwork by harmful external factors.

No need to frame - looks fabulous in this contemporary style.

I believe this gorgeous painting will create an impressive statement in your house.

MAINTENANCE

The artwork doesn't need a demanding maintenance because at the final stage of my creation I applied a transparent glossy varnish coat. Dust can only be removed with a dry cloth from time to time.
