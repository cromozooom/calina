## Moulin Rouge

Moulin Rouge is best known as the spiritual birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Here the painters found their inspiration, among them Toulouse-Lautrec, a regular customer in the area, who came to immortalize the strange, colorful scenes that lie midway between frenetic entertainment and the tragic lives of the lower classes, in famous paintings such as Le Chat Noir and La Goulue.

I tried to build a game between form and colour that both are in permanent competition.
