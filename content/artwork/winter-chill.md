The mixture of stars and snow rarely can be seen in a serene winter night.  
A great gift for someone special or nice addition to your home decor.  
I enjoyed how colours work together, mix and interact, along with the texture and pattern.

I can consider this technique experimental one being part of those works that just surprise you in the end. For dark areas I used wood stain powder, merging randomly over the entire canvas.

Last coat of gloss varnish gives preciousness and protects artwork by harmful external factors.
