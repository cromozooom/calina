## Colorful Butterfly

Butterfly, the symbol of personal transformation, a creature of beauty that always brings happiness to your soul.

In this large painting I wanted to represent the harmony of nature and sweetness of our life.

Because the butterfly is the process of transformation, it is said that when we see a butterfly is an opportunity to realize the changes in our lives and how we relate to them.
