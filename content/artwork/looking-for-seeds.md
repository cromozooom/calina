In this end of summer landscape I decided to approach completely different colour range than usual.

A structural landscape with the strong compositional lines and a cute hedgehog looking for the seeds.

This painting can be considered experimental, being part of those works that just surprise you in the end. Dark accents are made with wood stain powder, merging randomly over the entire canvas.

I use high quality colours and gallery wrap style canvas (has staples at the back), the edges are already coloured in harmony with the rest of the composition, so it can be hung on the wall already. Last coat of gloss varnish gives preciousness and protects artwork by harmful external factors.

It will arrive signed, titled, creationDated on the back and signed on the front accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity with corresponding data.

No need to frame - looks fabulous in this contemporary style.

I believe this gorgeous painting will create an impressive statement in your house.
