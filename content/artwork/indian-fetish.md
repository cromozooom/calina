## Small pink elefant

In this painting I tried to build a game between form and color that both are in permanent competition. Red and black are both pronounced colors with the strong character. In Indian mythology Elephant symbolizes good luck and success.

If you're a businessman and you need success in your work, you can put this small elephant painting to decorate your office where you work everyday.
