Yellow foliage of birch tree in the Autumn season and it's light creates the illusion of gold liefes.

I believe that in a birches forest you can feel more light, more life and more love!

The technique that I used can be considered experimental, part of those works that just surprise you on the final stage. Dark accents are textured by powder walnuts chrystals merging randomly over the entire canvas.

No need to be framed - looks fabulous as it is in a contemporaryÂ style.
