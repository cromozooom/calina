## Densest fog

I was inspired to paint this painting when I lived for a while in the south of Milan. Area renowned for its densest fog in Europe.

Shape of poplars guided me to a new technique, action and dripping technique.

I used pastel and delicate colors. The main color is white and colored grays. I used the palette knife technique that helps me to render the idea of ​​air stratification, usually seen in an Italian landscape.

Please note that colors of poplar foliage are painted in pearlescent colors.
