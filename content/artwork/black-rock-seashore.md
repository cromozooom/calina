Me and my family went for a few days on half term break in the western part of England last Autumn. I've always wished to see the power of the Ocean. We chose this tiny place called Porthmadog and I remember taking hundreds of photos at that simple, very wide, grey and minimalist beach. I felt very small in front of the Black Rocks, a feeling I can't describe unless I go back there again.

The main colour is brown and pastel yellow. I used the palette knife technique that helps me to render the idea of ​​air stratification, usually seen on a seascapes.

No need to frame - looks fabulous in this contemporary style.

I believe this gorgeous seashore painting will create an impressive statement in your house.
