This original landscape painting is about cold winter nights that we can meet at the North Pole where only polar bears are kings of the Northern Lands.<br>This painting can be considered experimental, being part of those works that just surprise me in the end. Paint is the stage where the color pigments dancing by the entire harmony of the painting. Dark accents are made with wood stain powder merging randomly over the entire canvas.
