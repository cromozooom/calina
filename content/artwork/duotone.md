## Monochrome Painting

I had always a special feeling for monochrome painting. When the artist has only one color on his palette for me represent a depth study and a big challenge for any subject.

I have been so pleased to realize at the end of my work that red color in monochrome is very difficult to approach. The RED is most challenging color from a visual point of view. So, I tried to control it better through a picture of fields captured by the red photographic filter.
