I was deeply impressed to see a herd of deer free and so friendly when I visited first time the Richmond Park in London. I remember that my family and I were very excited to take a photo with them considering that there were also stags with big horns.

The main colour is dark blue and the second one is pastel beige. I used the palette knife technique that helps me to render the idea of a deep starry night background stratification. I love drawing in a modern style without touching my canvas. The enamel colour and some tail of a brush loaded with it helps me to drip continuously on my canvas. I used this technique especially for the shape of the entire stag.
