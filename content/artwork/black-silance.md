The shape and color of the black swan challenged me to approach a new technique in this painting. To describe the form of swan i tried to use the dripping technique using enamel color instead of regular pencil. The black swan send to me a magical atmosphere of fairy tale.

For the last step of the work I used oil colors which helped me to convey this magic atmosphere on the lake.
